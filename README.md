# Deep Learning

This repository contains a collection of **Jupyter Notebooks** exploring Deep Learning techniques with modern neural network architectures and workflows.

## Topics Covered

- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Transfer Learning and Fine-Tuning with pretrained models
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs)
- Custom and pretrained Embeddings
- Input preprocessing layers (Keras)
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Introductory Generative AI techniques for images

## Running on Google Colab or Similar Cloud Platforms

All Notebooks are ideal for running on cloud-based platforms like **Google Colab** or **Kaggle Kernels** due to their ease of use and availability of powerful GPU/TPU resources. You can easily upload your dataset to Google Colab and run the notebooks with minimal setup.

## Requirements

Make sure to install the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Coming Soon

- Transformers (e.g., BERT, GPT-style architectures)
- Generative models using diffusion techniques
- Interactive error analysis and model visualization tools
- Cross-validation strategies and advanced regularization techniques
